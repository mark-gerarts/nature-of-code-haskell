[3D Perlin noise](sketch.gif)

I've resorted to [not-gloss](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/not-gloss) for
this sketch. It's a library for 3D graphics that is not affiliated with, but
heavily inspired by gloss. Its familiar feel made it a breeze to work with.

Should you want to run this example yourself: you need to zoom out a bit when
starting the sketch; I should look into setting a better default camera position
:').
