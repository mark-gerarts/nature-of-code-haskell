# Exercise I.8: Interactive 2D Perlin noise

The exercise is to play with the noise parameters and see the texture change.
This can easily be done by taking the [previous sketch](../PerlinNoise2D) and
changing a few values around.

There isn't much to learn from this, so I'm skipping this exercise. I've already
implemented an [interactive graph](../PerlinNoiseGraph), so adapting this to a
2D grid shouldn't be much work.
